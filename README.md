# Hi there 👋

Hey, I'm Fatemeh! I'm a researcher who loves to build robust, privacy-first systems. I'm currently a grad student exploring the intersection of **applied cryptography** and **machine learning**.

My passion is turning complex cryptographic theory into practical code. I enjoy everything from implementing foundational protocols to designing cutting-edge **Zero-Knowledge proof)** systems. My goal is to use tools like **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** and **Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)** to build technology that is not only powerful but also trustworthy, auditable, and secure.

I'm always open to collaborating on projects that use cryptography to solve real-world challenges.
